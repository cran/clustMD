Produces a number of plots as detailed above.

\description{
Produces a line plot of the estimated BIC values corresponding to each 
covariance model against the number of clusters fitted. For the optimal model
according to this criteria, a parallel coordinates plot of the cluster means
is produced along with a barchart or heatmap of the covariance matrices for
each cluster and a histogram of the clustering uncertainties.
