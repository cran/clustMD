\description{
Plots a parallel coordinates plot and dot plot of the estimated cluster 
means, a barplot of the variances by cluster for diagonal covariance models
or a heatmap of the covariance matrix for non-diagonal covariance 
structures, and a histogram of the clustering uncertainties for each 
observation.
